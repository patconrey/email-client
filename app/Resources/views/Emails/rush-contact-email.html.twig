Dear {{ name }},

<br>
<br>

My name is Michael Riemland, the President of The Delta Sigma Phi fraternity at the University of Kentucky. Each year our fraternity seeks out the brightest scholars from the incoming freshman class to encourage them to apply for the Johnathon Brigham Scholarship of Academic Excellence. Your name was recommended to us for your outstanding academic achievement.

<br>
<br>

The Johnathon Brigham Scholarship of Academic Excellence was created in memoriam of our departed brother, Johnathon Brigham, who demonstrated a lifelong passion for learning, outstanding work ethic, strong dedication to success, as well as a yearning to mentor others and help them succeed. In that spirit, our Chapter awards the Johnathon Brigham Scholarship of Academic Excellence each year to a freshman male who exhibits those same qualities of excellence that Johnathon exhibited during his time with us, at the University of Kentucky.  In order to apply for the scholarship, please complete the attached application, and submit it along with a resume, to deltasiguk@gmail.com. The deadline to apply is August 21st.

<br>
<br>

I am also personally inviting you to meet myself and the entire chapter during IFC Recruitment, August 20th through the 25th. While going through the recruitment process is not required in order to receive the scholarship, it is a great opportunity to find your place on campus right away. I have attached an informational packet that you may use to research our organization. The schedule of IFC Recruitment events can be found on  here, on their webpage.

<br>
<br>

We are excited for you and the entire class of 2021 to join us on campus. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me at 269.759.9489.

<br>
<br>

Go CATS!

<br>

Michael Riemland
